Learning is an uphill climb.

There are many things I want to learn and some things I know, but would like to learn more about.

Two of the most challenging areas of learning for me are staying focused and retaining knowledge.

The Ascension project is an effort to improve myself in those areas.

## Document Learnings

When learning something new, it is helpful to write things down.

This helps with knowledge retention by reinforcing the learning through an additional and powerful pathway to the brain.

So part of my plan is to document the things I learn every time I take on a new subject.

Whether it's video and article tutorials or reading docs and googling for answers, while coding, I need to stop what
I'm doing long enough to breathe and to write down what I've learned.

## Focus

I tend to get involved in one thing and obsess over it for hours while forgetting about other things that
need to be done.

I also experience burn out from staying on one topic for too long and to stay motivated, I need to jump to something
new and more exciting.

I know taking regular breaks and thinking about something else helps alleviate the burnout, and when I come back to
the topic I was studying, I feel refreshed and motivated again.

Planning and implementing focus sessions will help me break away from that bad habit of obsessing and burning
myself out.

I'm still working out exactly how I want to implement focus sessions and will add more information.

There are many more things I want to learn besides coding, but I will start with coding first.

There are also more things I need to improve in my life besides learning.

I like the 100DaysOfCode concept and want to expand on it.

I want to come up with a way of not just enforcing habits like coding for one hour every day but also for forcing
myself to focus and retain better.

So I'll be adding my own rules as to what constitutes meeting the challenge every day.
